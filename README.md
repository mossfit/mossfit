# Hi there, I'm Mainak Basak üëã

I'm a MSc. Software, AI Security Researcher, and GenAI Vulnerability Analyst with a passion for unraveling the mysteries of digital threats‚Äîthink of me as a scientific detective in the wild frontier of code!

---

## Who Am I?

- üß™ **Science Buff & Code Enthusiast**  
  I combine rigorous research with a love for experimentation. My lab? A place where malware meets the laws of physics and algorithms dance to the rhythm of data.

- üîí **AI Security Sleuth**  
  I build models that detect cyber threats with the precision of a particle accelerator. When it comes to anomaly detection and prompt injection attacks, I treat every bug like an unsolved scientific puzzle.

- üöÄ **Digital Explorer**  
  From transformer models that convert data into insights (no, not the ones that turn into cars) to pioneering methods for malware detection, I navigate the vast universe of network security with a microscope in one hand and a witty comment in the other.

## What I Do

- **Innovate:** Craft machine learning models that are as smart as they are unpredictable.
- **Secure:** Engineer frameworks to spot and neutralize digital threats before they even knock on your firewall.
- **Experiment:** Use the scientific method (and a dash of humor) to explore new frontiers in AI and network security.
- **Educate:** Share insights, quirky debug stories, and occasional puns through lectures, research papers, and open-source projects.

## Fun Facts

- **Debugging is my ‚ÄúError Exploration‚Äù**  
  I treat every bug as an exciting experiment‚Äîsometimes the universe even surprises me by compiling on the first try!

- **Comments with a Twist**  
  My code comments are known to be as entertaining as they are enlightening. After all, who said science can‚Äôt be funny?

- **Coffee & Code**  
  Much like a fine experiment, my best ideas often start with a strong cup of coffee and a spark of curiosity.
